Extrapolation (via cEn_calcExtrapWrapper) attempts to curve fit the output
of a data processing function (typically an entropy calculation function)
at various small sample counts to estimate the output at large sample counts.


Extrapolation is performed using the method described in Palmigiano 2017,
which is based on the method described in Strong 1998, which is based on
the analysis performed in Treves 1995:

(Palmigiano 2017) "Flexible Information Routing by Transient Synchrony"
(Strong 1998) "Entropy and Information in Neural Spike Trains"
(Treves 1995) "The Upward Bias in Measures of Information Derived From
  Limited Data Samples"


For several values of N, M subsets of size (nsamples/N) are selected from
the sample data. The entropy calculation is run on these M subsets and the
results averaged, producing a result for the chosen value of N. A
A quadratic fit is performed to the results (as a function of N), and the
Y intercept (N = 0) is taken as the estimated infinite-length output.


An "extrapolation parameter structure" is a structure with the following
fields:

"divisors" is a vector containing divisors for nsamples.   Default: [1:10]
"testcount" is the number of tests to average for each divisor.   Default: 3

NOTE - If there are fewer than three divisors, the order of the curve fit
will be reduced. A noteworthy use of this is divisors = [ 1 ], testcount
= 1 to return the calculation result without extrapolation.
